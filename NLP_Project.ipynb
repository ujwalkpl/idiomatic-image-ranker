To make the sentence clearer, we need to replace \"graveyard shift\" with a clear explanation of its meaning. \\n\\nThe sentence could be rewritten as:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s late night to early morning shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, a more common and well-known part of the \"graveyard shift\" is that it usually refers to a shift that starts at midnight and goes until the early morning hours (often until 8 a.m.). Another common understanding is that a \"graveyard shift\" is a work shift that occurs during the \"dead of night,\" which makes it a less popular shift because it is a time when most people are asleep. \\n\\nHowever, the sentence already mentions a \"10 pm slot,\" so it seems that the \"graveyard shift\" should be a time slot that is later than 10 pm. Thus, a \"graveyard shift\" here likely means a very late night or overnight shift. \\n\\nHowever, a \"10 pm slot\" itself might be considered a part of the \"late night\" programming, so it might be a bit confusing here. However, a \"graveyard shift\" is usually even later than a \"10 pm slot.\" \\n\\nAnother part of the sentence mentions that he moved \"to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s graveyard shift.\" This implies that the \"graveyard shift\" is a less prestigious or lower profile position compared to his previous \"10 pm slot.\" \\n\\nBased on this, a more specific and clear way to explain \"graveyard shift\" might be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s overnight shift (typically from midnight to early morning).\"\\n\\nHowever, a more concise and still clear way to make the sentence more explicit might be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s overnight shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"overnight shift\" might still be a bit vague. Another way to make it more specific could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s late night to early morning shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"overnight shift\" is a well-understood term that should suffice here. Thus, a well-reasoned and clear sentence could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s overnight shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"overnight shift\" might still be a bit of a \"term\" itself. Another way to make it even more explicit could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s shift that runs from late night until early morning.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"overnight shift\" is a well-known term that should make the sentence clear enough. Thus, a well-reasoned and clear sentence could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s overnight shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, a more common and well-understood term for a \"graveyard shift\" is a \"midnight shift\" or \"overnight shift.\" Another way to make it more specific could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s midnight to early morning shift.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"graveyard shift\" is a well-known term itself, so another way to make it more specific could be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s late-night shift (often referred to as the graveyard shift, which typically runs from midnight until early morning).\"\\n\\nHowever, a more straightforward and less verbose way might be:\\n\"He moved from the 10 pm slot to his lower profile life as a DJ on Radio Norwich\\'s late-night shift (which typically runs from midnight until early morning).\"\\n\\nHowever, a more common and well-understood term for a \"graveyard shift\" is a \"midnight shift\" or \"overnight shift.\" Another way to make it more specific could be:\\n\"He
